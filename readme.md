# Simple notes - Ionic Version
The reason I started to port the app to ionic was to simplify the UI due to the future features I want to add, I realized I had to make a more complex UI to not mess it all up. Other reason I chose ionic to port the app was because, as you may have seen, I was making the app UI material-design like, so... I didn't want to create a lot of material styles and reusable components because... **They all were already created!**

# Usage
If you want to fork the app and compile on your machine you need to have installed ionic, of course; JDK8 and the android-sdk tools to get it working. Eather way, the build instructions can be found in the ionic documentation.
